						<p> All tournament long, match balls will contain a sensor that collects spatial positioning data in real time — the first World Cup to employ such a ball-tracking mechanism. This, combined with existing optical tracking tools, will make VAR (video assistant referees) and programs like offside reviews more accurate and streamlined than they’ve ever been. Combining these two forms of tracking has long been a holy grail of sorts in technology circles, and FIFA’s use of the ball sensor in particular will serve as a highly public test case over the next four weeks.</p>

					<h2>Creating a modern atmosphere</h2>
					<p>Speak to fans in Doha and nobody has a bad word to say. When you announce you’re a journalist there’s a narrowing of the eyes, an uncertainty about what you might ask, but when it’s clear it’s the experience and not the host country you want to talk about there’s a list of positives: transport is great, the city is safe and the experience at the matches has been wonderful..</p>

						<h4>How-To: Play Attacking Football</h4>
						<p>With the focus on attacking soccer now being vital to a manager’s future at any club, the emergence of the 4-2-3-1 formation has become widespread.

							Having the defensive advantage of a back four to protect the goalkeeper, the two central midfielders act as both defensive cover, but also to ensure a quick transition to either winger or to the attacking midfielder.
							
							Once the ball is in the opponent’s half, the midfielders often hold position, and the wingers and attacking midfielder go forward to support a lone striker.
							
							The benefits of this tactic are clear to see, with both attack and defense having the flexibility to move forwards or backward depending on possession of the ball..</p>

						<h4>How-To: Pick a Midfielder</h4>
						<p>Many call the midfielder an offensive midfielder. Normally, he is a footballer who, playing between midfield and forward, serves as a link between them. They are midfielders who move ahead of the midfielder, whether they are pivot, double pivot or trivote. This player must have a great vision of the game to know how to find spaces in the rival defense and create numerical superiority in the offensive phase, as well as a great tactical imbalance to be able to overcome one-on-one situations..</p>
